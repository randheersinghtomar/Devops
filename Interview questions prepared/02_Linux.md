# Q1. Tell me about your Linux experience.

## Answer

I have around 5 years of experience as a Linux and AWS Support Engineer.

In my current project, I am responsible for monitoring Linux servers, handling production incidents and supporting AWS infrastructure.

I work on EC2 instances hosted on AWS.

My daily work includes checking CloudWatch and Grafana alerts, troubleshooting Linux issues, monitoring application services, patching servers, extending EBS volumes, checking logs and coordinating with Application, Network and Cloud teams.

---

# Q2. What are your day-to-day Linux activities?

## Answer

My day starts with checking monitoring dashboards like CloudWatch, Grafana and Opsgenie.

I first verify whether there are any critical alerts like High CPU, High Memory, Disk Utilization, Website Down or Service Down.

Then I check Jira for any new incidents or pending tickets.

If I receive any production alert, first I verify whether it is a genuine issue or a temporary spike.

Then I login to the affected server using SSH.

After login, I check CPU, Memory, Disk Utilization, Running Services, Application Logs and Network connectivity.

If required, I coordinate with the Application Team, Network Team, Database Team or Cloud Team.

After resolving the issue, I verify the application, monitor CloudWatch dashboard again and update the Jira ticket.

# Q3. What is NFS? How do you mount it and how does the end user access it?

## Answer

NFS (Network File System) is a file-level storage protocol that allows multiple Linux servers to access the same shared directory over the network.

It is commonly used to share application files, backup directories, and common data between multiple servers.

### Steps to mount an NFS share:

1. Check the available NFS exports on the server
```
showmount -e <NFS_Server_IP>
```

3. Create a mount point on the client
   ```
   mkdir /mnt/nfs
   ```
   
4. Mount the NFS share
   ```
   mount -t nfs <NFS_Server_IP>:/shared_data /mnt/nfs
   ```

5. Verify the mount
```
   df -h
   mount | grep nfs
```

6. To make the mount permanent, add an entry in /etc/fstab.
```
   10.0.1.10:/shared_data    /mnt/nfs    nfs    defaults    0 0
```

### How does the end user access it?

The end user does not connect directly to the NFS server. The NFS share is mounted on the Linux application server, and the application accesses the files through the mounted directory. The user only interacts with the application, not the NFS server.

# Q4. Which Linux commands do you use daily?

## Answer

I use below commands almost every day.

Check CPU

```bash
top
```

Check Memory

```bash
free -h
```

Check Disk

```bash
df -h
```

Check Directory Size

```bash
du -sh *
```

Check Running Process

```bash

```

Check Services

```bash
systemctl status <service-name>
```

Check Logs

```bash
journalctl -xe
tail -100 /var/log/messages
```

Check Listening Ports

```bash
ss -tulnp
```

These commands help me during daily production troubleshooting.

# Q5. How do you troubleshoot High CPU Utilization?

## Answer

First I check the alert in CloudWatch or Grafana.

I verify whether CPU utilization is continuously high or it is just a temporary spike.

I also check since when CPU utilization is high.

If Auto Scaling is configured, I verify whether a new instance has been launched automatically.

Then I login to the server using SSH.

I check CPU utilization using

```bash
top
```

or

```bash
htop
```

I identify which process is consuming high CPU.

Then I check whether any deployment, cron job, backup or log rotation activity is running.

If it is an expected activity, I monitor it until it completes.

If it is not expected, I check application logs and system logs.

If required, I coordinate with the Application Team.

I never kill any production process without approval.

If restart is required, I take approval first.

Finally, I verify CloudWatch dashboard, make sure CPU utilization is back to normal, update Jira and prepare the RCA.

---

# Q6. How do you troubleshoot High Memory Utilization?

## Answer

First I check the alert in CloudWatch or Grafana.

I verify whether memory utilization is continuously increasing or it is a temporary spike.

Then I login to the server using SSH.

I check memory using

```bash
free -h
```

Then I check which process is consuming more memory using

```bash
top
```

or

```bash
ps -ef
```

I also check whether swap memory is being used.

Then I review application logs.

If required, I coordinate with the Application Team.

If restart is required, I take approval first.

Finally, I monitor CloudWatch dashboard again, verify memory utilization and update the Jira ticket.

---

# Q7. Disk Utilization is 95% or 100%. What will you do?

## Answer

First I check the alert in CloudWatch or Grafana.

I verify whether disk utilization is continuously increasing or it is a temporary spike.

Then I login to the server using SSH.

First I check which filesystem is full.

```bash
df -h
```

Then I identify which directory is consuming more space.

```bash
du -sh * /var/*
```

In most cases, application logs consume more space.

As per our company SOP, I first archive the old logs if required.

Then I remove logs which are approved for cleanup.

I also verify whether log rotation is working properly.(cat /etc/logrotate.conf)

If logrotate is not working, I fix the issue or coordinate with the Application Team.

If temporary files or old backup files are consuming space, I clean them after confirmation.

If disk utilization is still high, I coordinate with the Cloud Team to extend the EBS volume.

After extending the EBS volume, I extend the filesystem if required.

Finally, I verify the application, monitor CloudWatch dashboard, update Jira and prepare the RCA.

---

# Q8. How do you check logs in Linux?

## Answer

First I identify which application or service is having the issue.

Then I check the system logs using

```bash
journalctl -xe
```

If it is an application issue, I check the application log path.

I mainly look for Error, Warning and Exception messages.

I also check the timestamp to match it with the alert time.

Based on the log findings, I continue troubleshooting or coordinate with the Application Team.

---

# Q9. How do you check whether a service is running?

## Answer

First I check the service status.

```bash
systemctl status <service-name>
```

If the service is stopped, I don't restart it immediately.

First I review the logs.

```bash
journalctl -u <service-name>
```

Then I identify the reason behind the failure.

If required, I coordinate with the Application Team.

After approval, I restart the service.

Then I verify that the application port is listening.

```bash
ss -tulnp
```

Finally, I verify the application is accessible and update the Jira ticket.

---

# Q10. What is iSCSI? How is it different from NFS?

## Answer

My production experience is mainly with AWS EBS volumes, which are block storage. I understand that iSCSI is a block storage protocol that provides remote disks over an IP network. Although I haven't configured iSCSI in production, I know its architecture, basic workflow, and how it differs from NFS.

# 🐧 Linux Interview Questions - Part 02

# Q11. SSH is not working. What will you do?

## Answer

First I verify whether the EC2 instance is in the Running state.

Then I check both **System Status Check** and **Instance Status Check**.

Next I verify the Security Group and make sure port **22** is allowed.

Then I verify Network ACL, Route Table and Internet Gateway if it is a public server.

I also verify whether I am using the correct username and PEM key.

If SSH is still not working, I use EC2 Instance Connect, Systems Manager or Serial Console if available.

After logging into the server, I check whether the SSH service is running.

```bash
systemctl status sshd
```

Then I check SSH logs.

```bash
journalctl -u sshd
```

I also check whether the disk is full because sometimes SSH does not work if the root filesystem is 100%.

If required, I restart the SSH service after verifying the issue.

Finally, I verify SSH connectivity and update the Jira ticket.

---

# Q12. Server is slow. How will you troubleshoot?

## Answer

First, I will verify the alert in CloudWatch or Grafana and check since when the server is slow. I also verify whether it is affecting one server or multiple servers.

Then I will login to the server using SSH and check the basic resources.

```bash
top
free -h
df -h
```

I check whether the Load Average is high.

```bash
uptime
```

I identify whether any process is consuming high resources.

I also check application logs and system logs to see if there are any errors.

If all server resources are normal, I check with the Application Team whether any deployment or batch job is running.

### If everything looks normal on the Linux server, then I check the AWS infrastructure.

I verify that both EC2 Status Checks are passed.
I check whether the EBS volume is facing any IOPS or throughput issue.
If the application is behind a Load Balancer, I verify the Target Group Health.
If Auto Scaling is configured, I check whether any recent scaling activity has happened.

Finally, I verify server performance, monitor CloudWatch dashboard and update the Jira ticket.

---

# Q22. How do you mount a filesystem permanently? Explain the fields in /etc/fstab.

## Answer

The /etc/fstab (File System Table) file is used to mount filesystems automatically during system boot.

If I mount a filesystem using the mount command, it is only temporary. After a reboot, the mount is lost. To make it permanent, I add an entry in the /etc/fstab file.

### Explain the fields in /etc/fstab
```
UUID=2c8f4d7e-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx   /data   ext4   defaults   0   2

UUID  MountPoint  FileSystem Type    Mount Option  Dump    fsck Order

If required, I restore the server using the latest EBS snapshot or follow the rollback procedure as per company SOP.

I coordinate with the Patch Management Team and Application Team.

Finally, I verify the application, update Jira and prepare the RCA.

---

# Q28. Some users can access the application, but others cannot. How will you troubleshoot?

## Answer

First, I will check how many users are affected and whether they are from the same location or different locations.

If only a few users are facing the issue, then I will ask them to check from another network or mobile hotspot. This helps me identify whether the issue is user-side or network-related.

Then I will check whether all affected users are using the same VPN, ISP, or office network.

If users from the same location are affected, I will coordinate with the Network Team to check DNS resolution, VPN connectivity, firewall rules, or any routing issue.

If users from different locations are affected, then I will check the Load Balancer and Target Group Health to verify whether traffic is reaching all backend servers properly.

If required, I will also check the application logs to identify whether any requests are failing on a particular backend server.

Finally, after identifying and fixing the issue, I will verify with the affected users that the application is working properly and then update the Jira ticket.

---

# Q29. Tell me about one production issue you handled.

## Answer

During my night shift, we suddenly received multiple alerts that more than 100 physical servers were showing Host Down.

First I verified the issue by checking router connectivity and trying SSH access to multiple servers.

Both router ping and SSH were failing.

So I suspected a Data Center level issue instead of a server issue.

Immediately I created an Incident Bridge on Microsoft Teams.

I informed the client and shared all troubleshooting details.

Then I contacted the Equinix Data Center Team.

After investigation, they confirmed that one PDU had failed.

Once the PDU issue was resolved, all servers gradually became reachable.

Then I verified server health, closed the incident and prepared the RCA.

---

# Q30. Tell me about one AWS production issue you handled.

## Answer

CloudWatch generated a High Disk Utilization alert for one production EC2 instance.

First I checked the CloudWatch dashboard to verify whether the utilization was continuously increasing or it was only a temporary spike.

Then I connected to the EC2 instance using SSH.

I checked the filesystem.

```bash
df -h
```

Then I identified which directory was consuming more space.

```bash
du -sh /var/*
```

I found that application log files were consuming most of the disk space.

As per our company SOP, I archived the logs first.

Then I removed old logs that were approved for cleanup.

I also verified that logrotate was working properly.

Even after cleanup, disk utilization was still high.

So I increased the EBS volume from the AWS Console.

Then I extended the filesystem.

After that I verified the application, monitored CloudWatch dashboard until disk utilization returned to normal, updated the Jira ticket and prepared the RCA.
